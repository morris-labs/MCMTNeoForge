/**
 * The single point every multi-core tick hook in the patched Minecraft sources calls into.
 *
 * <p>Corresponds to JMT-MCMT's {@code ASMHookTerminator}. Where JMT reached these methods through ASM
 * transformers, we call them directly from the patched sources; the intent is the same, and so is the rule that
 * every hook site stays a one-line call-out so the patch diffs remain readable.
 *
 * <p>The hook sites, in the order a tick reaches them:
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>{@link #preTick} / {@link #postTick} bracket {@code MinecraftServer.tickChildren}, opening and closing the
 * barrier that everything dispatched during the tick is registered against.
 * <li>{@link #callTick} dispatches one {@code ServerLevel.tick}.
 * <li>{@link #callEntityTick} dispatches one entity tick, from {@code ServerLevel.tick}.
 * <li>{@link #callBlockEntityTick} dispatches one block-entity tick, from {@code Level.tickBlockEntities}.
 * <li>{@link #callTickChunk} dispatches one chunk/environment tick, from {@code ServerChunkCache.tickChunks}.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>All four hooks now dispatch to the pool.
 *
 * <h2>The barrier</h2>
 *
 * <p>Synchronisation is a single {@link Phaser} per tick, following JMT-MCMT. {@link #preTick} creates it and
 * registers the server thread as one party. Each dispatch registers another party and the task deregisters when
 * it finishes. {@link #postTick} then arrives and waits for the phase to advance, which cannot happen until
 * every task has deregistered. So the barrier is "the server thread waits for all outstanding tick work",
 * expressed without a counter and a condition variable.
 *
 * <p>The phaser also carries the memory visibility the whole design rests on: everything a worker wrote to the
 * world before its {@code arriveAndDeregister} happens-before everything the server thread reads after its
 * {@code arriveAndAwaitAdvance}.
