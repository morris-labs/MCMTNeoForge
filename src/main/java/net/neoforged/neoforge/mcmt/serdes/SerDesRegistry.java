/**
 * Answers the one question the tick hooks ask: may this class run free, and if not, how should it be run?
 *
 * <p>Filters are consulted in priority order and the first opinion wins:
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>{@link PistonFilter}, {@link HopperFilter}, {@link ModdedHopperFilter}, {@link ItemEntityFilter},
 * {@link ExperienceOrbFilter} and {@link EntityFilter} — classes known to reach outside themselves, vanilla or
 * modded. Not overridable, because overriding them does not make them safe.
 * <li>{@link ConfigFilter} — the server owner's white and black lists.
 * <li>{@link AutoFilter} — classes that have already thrown once while running in parallel.
 * <li>{@link VanillaFilter} — everything else in {@code net.minecraft}, per {@code vanillaDefault}.
 * <li>{@link DefaultFilter} — modded code of unknown thread-safety; chunk-locked by default.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>The answer is cached per {@code (hook, class)}, so the hot path is a single map lookup rather than a walk
 * down the filter chain. {@link #invalidate()} clears the cache; it has to be called whenever anything a filter
 * consults changes, which is why config reload and {@code AutoFilter} demotion both go through here.
